      <p class="content">Hi! My name is Rachel Berry. Welcome to my ever-changing (somewhat incomplete) portfolio website. This week's theme is minimalism! As a junior at Indiana University studying Informatics, I am currently taking a web design class, which is why this site will be changing on a weekly basis. Be sure to check back regularly to what the site grow and transform!</p>

      <p class="content">I am looking for an internship for summer 2016! I love interface design and application development, and I have professional experience in both. Some of the projects I have worked on are listed below. If you are looking for a design or development intern for next summer please feel free to <a href="http://www.racheljberry.com/RachelBerry_Resume.pdf">check out my resume</a> and <a href= "http://www.linkedin.com/in/racheljberry">connect with me on Linkedin</a>!</p>
